### Prerequisites 🔐
To use **SendEase**, you'll need to generate an **App Password** from your email provider (especially if you're using Gmail).

**Why an App Password?**
If you are using Gmail or another email provider with two-factor authentication (2FA), you will need to create an **App Password** instead of using your regular email password.

---

### How to get an App Password 🔑
1. **Go to your email account settings**.
2. **Navigate to Security**.
3. **Look for the "App Passwords" section** (this may require you to enable 2FA if you haven't already).
4. **Generate an App Password** specifically for this application.

Once you have it, use that password in the app settings instead of your regular email password. 🛡️

### How to Use 💻
1. **Download and Install**: Download the executable file for your operating system.
2. **Set Up**: Enter your email credentials (using the App Password).
3. **Send Emails**: Add recipients, subject, body, and attachments, then hit send!
4. **Import Emails**: You can easily import recipients from a .txt file or an .xls/.xlsx file:
	•	Text files: Each email address should be on a new line.
	•	Excel files: Simply import from the column containing email addresses.
The app will validate the email format and notify you if any invalid addresses are found.
